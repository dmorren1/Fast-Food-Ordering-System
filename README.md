Fast Food Ordering System
Description:

Developed a Python program for a Fast Food Ordering System, enabling customers to view the menu, add items to their order, view their current order, and finalize their order. The program provides an interactive and user-friendly interface, allowing customers to easily navigate menu options and manage their orders.
Key Features:

    Menu Display: Implemented a function to display the available menu items, including "Burger," "Fries," "Pizza," and "Drink," with corresponding item numbers.

    Order Management: Created functions for users to add items to their order by entering the item numbers. Users can view their current order and finalize it when ready.

    Interactive Interface: Designed an interactive console-based interface where users can input their choices, add items, and view their orders seamlessly.

Functions:

    display_menu() -> None:
        Displays the available menu items along with their corresponding item numbers.

    add_to_order(item_number: int) -> None:
        Adds the selected item (based on item number) to the customer's order list.

    view_order() -> None:
        Displays the customer's current order, listing the items they have selected.

    main():
        Main function managing user interactions, displaying menu options, and calling appropriate functions based on user choices.

Technologies Used:

    Programming Language: Python 3
    Development Environment: Python IDLE (or any Python-compatible editor)
